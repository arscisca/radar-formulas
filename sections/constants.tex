\section{Constants}
Constant which appear in the equations and useful quantities to help in computations.

\begin{multicols}{4} \noindent
	$$ c \simeq 3 \cdot 10^8 \SI{}{m / s}
		\endnote{Speed of light}
		$$
	$$ \tau_c = \SI{66.7}{ns / m}
		\endnote{Time needed for light to travel for 1 m considering the full roundtrip. This is helpful for quick computations like "what's the range of an object if the time of flight is 120 ns?"}
